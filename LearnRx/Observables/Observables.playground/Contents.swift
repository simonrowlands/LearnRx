/* RxSwift: What is it?
 
 In the words of Wikipedia, Reactive Programming is:
 A programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change. This means that it should be possible to express static or dynamic data flows with ease in the programming languages used, and that the underlying execution model will automatically propagate changes through the data flow
 
 Or in short; Reactive programming is the idea that we can easily create data flows and automatically react to their changes.
 
 RxSwift enables such behaviour using Observables, Subscriptions and Operators, all of which are covered in this project.
 
 `Observable Sequences` or `Observables`, are the data flows we use to emit data events. Everything else in Rx is based on, or operates on these Observables. We use Subscriptions to receive and react to these data events and use Operators to perform logic on the data itself.
 
 For now though, lets have a look at Observables and Subscriptions.
 
 Run the playground up to each example to see what it is doing.
 */



/*      Observables     */

/*
 Here are some examples of how we can initialise an Observable.
 
 Note that once an Observable is initialised with a value, we cannot add new values into its stream, that is covered later in the chapter `Subjects`.
 */

example(of: "just, of, from, range") {
    let _ = Observable.just(1)
    let _ = Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
    let _ = Observable.of([1, 2, 3])
    let _ = Observable.from([1, 2, 3])
    let _ = Observable.range(start: 1, count: 10)
    
    /*
     There is no output in the console here, this is because there is no subscriber listening for the events!
     */
}

/*
 As mentioned before, we use Subscribers to receive/react to Observable emissions.
 
 .subscribe provides several handlers for reacting to an Observable. In the example we have only used (onNext:) to react to each emission.
 There are more handlers covered in this project
 */

example(of: "subscribe") {
    let observable = Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
    
    observable.subscribe(onNext: { element in
        print(element)
    })
    
    /*
     Now we have subscribed and added a print on receiving each next event, we can see the elements output in the console
     */
}


/*
 An Empty observable is simply an observable with no elements to emit. As a type is required, we use `Void` to declare it.
 An Empty observable will never emit next events but will emit completed/terminated events.
 */

example(of: "empty") {
    let observable = Observable<Void>.empty()
    
    observable.subscribe(onNext: { element in
        print(element)
    }, onCompleted: { // Note how we have added another handler here, this is called when the Observable Sequence completes
        print("Completed")
    })
}


/*
 A Never observable is similar to an Empty observable; it has no values and will not emit next events.
 The difference here though is that it does not emit completed events as it never terminates!
 Try running the playground; you will see that there is no "Completed" event log
 */

example(of: "never") {
    let observable = Observable<Any>.never()
    
    observable.subscribe(onNext: { element in
        print(element)
    }, onCompleted: {
        print("Completed")
    })
}

/*
 Subscriptions in Rx are `Disposable` types. When you subscribe to an Observable, the Subscription keeps a strong reference to it.
 
 We need to dispose of these Subscriptions and Observables somehow to avoid memory leaks
 
 RxSwift has its own deallocation method: dispose() as shown below
 */

example(of: "dispose") { // Manually disposing
    let observable = Observable.of("A", "B", "C").subscribe(onNext: { element in
        print(element)
    }, onDisposed: {
        print("Disposed!")
    })
    observable.dispose()
}

/*
 There is a more convenient way of handling the disposal of subscriptions; the Rx class `DisposeBag`
 DisposeBags track all of the Disposables that are added to them and disposes of them when the DisposeBag is deinitialised
 */

example(of: "DisposeBag") { // Automatically disposing
    let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    
    Observable.of("A", "B", "C").subscribe(onNext: { letter in
        print(letter)
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
    
    Observable.of("D", "E", "F").subscribe(onNext: { letter in
        print(letter)
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
}

/*
 This does cause potential for a retain cycle however; you must be careful not to use strong reference to the Observables owner when using disposed(by:)
 
 In a ViewController scenario; the ViewController has a strong reference to the DisposeBag, the DisposeBag has a strong reference to the Subscription and the Subscription, in theory, could have a strong reference to the ViewController
 
 You can avoid this by manually using .dispose() or more simply using a weak reference within the Subscription
 
 Below is an example of a retain cycle and its non retain-cycle counterpart
 */

example(of: "DisposeBag retain cycle") {
    
    class HomeViewController: UIViewController {
        
        let numberLabel: UILabel? = nil
        
        let disposeBag = DisposeBag() // Strong reference, ViewController -> DisposeBag
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            
            let observable = Observable.of(1, 2)
            
            // Bad
            observable.subscribe(onNext: { element in
                self.numberLabel?.text = "\(element)" // Strong reference, Subscription -> ViewController
            }).disposed(by: disposeBag) // Strong reference, DisposeBag -> Subscription
            
            // Good
            observable.subscribe(onNext: { [weak self] element in
                self?.numberLabel?.text = "\(element)" // WEAK reference, Subscription -> ViewController
            }).disposed(by: disposeBag) // Strong reference, DisposeBag -> Subscription
        }
    }
}

/*
 Using the .deferred method, you can create a factory that returns an Observable within its closure.
 
 This allows us to use a different Observable depending on a condition or a state, in the below example we are returning a different Observable depending on the state of the `flip` bool.
 
 This is useful in the scenario when you need to create the Observable at a future point in time
 */

example(of: "deferred") {
    let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    var flip = false
    
    let factory: Observable<Int> = Observable.deferred {
        
        flip = !flip
        
        if flip {
            return Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
        } else {
            return Observable.of(4, 5, 6)
        }
    }
    
    func subscribe(to observable: Observable<Int>) {
        observable.subscribe(onNext: { element in
            print(element)
        }).disposed(by: disposeBag)
        print()
    }
    
    subscribe(to: factory) // Flips the bool, prints 1 2 3
    subscribe(to: factory) // Flips the bool, prints 4 5 6
    subscribe(to: factory) // Flips the bool, prints 1 2 3
}

/*
 Now we have looked at some of the available initializers for Observables, it is time to create our own!
 
 The .create() method allows us to implement the result of calling .subscribe on the Observable.
 
 As mentioned earlier, Subscriptions are actually of Disposable type and .create() requires a Disposable to be returned. We can use the convenience Disposable initializer: Disposables.create()
 */

example(of: "create") {
    let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    
    enum MyError: Error {
        case anError
    }
    
    Observable<String>.create { observer in
        observer.onNext("1")
        observer.onError(MyError.anError)
        observer.onCompleted()  // Note how this and the line below is not printed as the error has already terminated the Subscription
        observer.onNext("?")
        return Disposables.create()

        onDisposed: { print("Disposed")
    }).disposed(by: disposeBag)

/* There are three kinds of Observable traits in RxSwift: Completable, Single, and Maybe. */

/* Completables
 
 A Completable will emit a .completed OR .error event.
 
 You could use a completable when you only care that an operation completed successfully or failed, such as a file write.

/* Singles
 Singles will emit either a .success(value) or an .error event.
 It functions in the same way as a Completable except it emits a value on its completion
 
 The .success(value) is a combination of a .next and .completed event.
 
 This is useful for one-time processes that will either succeed and yield a value or fail, such as downloading data or loading it from disk.

/* Maybe
 Maybe is a combination of a Single and Completable, it can either emit a .success(value), .completed, or an .error.
 
 If you need to implement an operation that could either succeed with a value, complete without a value or error then you should use Maybe.
