 An Empty observable is simply an observable with no elements. As a type is required, we use `Void` to declare it.

/*
 A Never observable is similar to an Empty observable; it has no values and will not emit next events.
 The difference here though is that it does not emit completed events as it never terminates!
 Try running the playground; you will see that there is no "Completed" log below

/*
 There are several initializers for observables as we have seen above, there are some more covered below
 Most of these are self explanatory but are covered for clarity and reference
 */

/*
 You can declare an observable with a range, this will give the observable a sequence using the values of the range i.e. 1 - 10
 This is the same as declaring an Observable using .of(1, 2, 3...)
 */

/*
 Subscriptions in Rx are `Disposable` types. When you subscribe to an Observable, the Subscription (or Disposable) keeps a strong reference to the Observable. This means that there is a retain cycle: If the user tries to pop a view using Observables from the navigation stack, the Observables will never be de-allocated.
 
 RxSwift counters this issue with its own deallocation method: dispose() as shown below
 
 This disposes of the Subscription immediately meaning that you could keep this code in the ViewControllers deinit method to dispose the Subscriptions on navigating backwards
 
 */

example(of: "dispose") { // Manually disposing
    let observable = Observable.of("A", "B", "C").subscribe(onNext: { element in
        print(element)
    }, onDisposed: {
        print("Disposed!")
    })
    observable.dispose()
}

/*
 There is a more convenient way of handling the disposal of subscriptions, this is the Rx class `DisposeBag`
 DisposeBags track all of the disposables that are added to them and disposes them all when it is deinitialised
 */

example(of: "DisposeBag") { // Automatically disposing
    let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
    
    Observable.of("A", "B", "C").subscribe {
        print($0)
    }.disposed(by: disposeBag)
    
    Observable.of("D", "E", "F").subscribe {
        print($0)
    }.disposed(by: disposeBag)
}

/*
 This does cause further potential for a retain cycle however; you must be careful not to use disposed(by:) when the subscription has a strong reference to the ViewController
 
 This is because the ViewController has a strong reference to the DisposeBag, the DisposeBag has a strong reference to the Subscription and the Subscription has a strong reference to the ViewController
 
 You can avoid this by using .dispose() or using a weak reference within the Subscription
 
 Below are some examples of these scenarios

/*
 There are three kinds of traits in RxSwift: Single, Maybe, and Completable.
 
 Singles
 Singles will emit either a .success(value) or an .error event.
 .success(value) is actually a combination of the .next and .completed events.
 This is useful for one-time processes that will either succeed and yield a value or fail, such as downloading data or loading it from disk.
 
 Completables
 A Completable will only emit a .completed or .error event.
 It doesn't emit any value.
 You could use a completable when you only care that an operation completed successfully or failed, such as a file write.
 
 Maybes
 Maybe is a mashup of a Single and Completable.
 It can either emit a .success(value), .completed, or .error.
 If you need to implement an operation that could either succeed or fail, and optionally return a value on success, then Maybe is your ticket.
