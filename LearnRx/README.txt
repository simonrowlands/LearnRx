This project has been created to demonstrate the use cases of RxSwift with examples in an attempt to provide a reference point for other developers integrating Rx into their projects.

The plan for this project is to create some playgrounds for some core Rx examples i.e. Observables and to create an application that integrates the use cases for these examples.
